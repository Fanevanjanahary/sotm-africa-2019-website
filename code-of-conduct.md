#### Code of Conduct

Our activities and events should foster meaningful collaboration between participants, community members, and government partners. We expect internal governance, participants, advocacy, activities, and events to:

-  Provide a safe, respectful, and welcoming environment where all are free to fully express their ideas and identities free from discrimination or harassment. All spaces, online or physical, shall be governed by SOTMA  anti-harassment policy.
- Default to open and work to be objective.
- Collaborate for the purpose of generating ideas that empower, innovate, and develop local capacity.
- Presume the value of others and cherish everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions.
- Encourage participants to listen as much as they speak,and  ask respectful questions.
- Foster energy that builds “yes, and” ideas and permit the ability to stretch. 
- Build ideas, tools, and platforms that are open and free for reuse. Activities should prioritize public use, not private gain.
- Actively involve stakeholders, community groups, and those with subject matter expertise in all decision-making processes.
- Ensure that relationships and conversations between, and among, conference participants, SOTMAfrica committees, and our host community and their partners, and members of the Openstreetmap community — remain respectful, participatory, and productive.
