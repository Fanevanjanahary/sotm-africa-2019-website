  title: "Open Cities Ignite Francophone Open Cities Ignite Anglophone"
  description: "In 2018, Open Cities Africa was launched and implemented in 12 cities in Sub-Saharan Africa to engage local government, civil society, and the private sector to develop the geospatial information necessary to meet urban resilience, and disaster risk management challenges. In this session, the OpenDRI team from the World Bank, coordinators of the project, will present an overview of the Open Cities methodology, and speak to the importance of open data to support decision making in vulnerable countries. Representatives from each of our 12 cities will present a short ignite talk showcasing their Open Cities journey. Talks will cover the following thematic areas; government stakeholder engagement, educational engagement, community engagement, data for decision making, and the future of the initiative (or, how the project has evolved since inception). Ignite talks will be followed by a short poster session, where conference attendees will have time to engage with city implementation teams to find out more about each individual project. "
