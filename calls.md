#### Call for Participation 


In **November 2019** the OpenStreetMap community in Africa will come together for our annual State of the Map Africa conference. It is set to be an exciting three day event where mappers, programmers, practitioners, entrepreneurs, and policy makers will share their passion for OpenStreetMap.

You can be a part of this event by proposing a talk to either the main conference tracks or the academic part of the conference. You are encouraged to submit proposals for talks, academic talks, lightning talks, and workshops of any topic related to the world of OpenStreetMap. If you require a grant or scholarship to attend, donâ€™t hassle to apply for a scholarship!

Call for various sessions and their deadlines will be made available **SOON**.
