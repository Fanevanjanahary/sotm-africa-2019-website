#### Call for Participation 

In **November 2019** the OpenStreetMap community in Africa will come together for our annual State of the Map Africa conference. The 2019 State of the Map Africa will build on a new strategy envisioned for Openstreetmap Africa as a renewed, strong, and growing network, and as part of the global open mapping movement.

This year’s conference will provide a diverse and fun space for everyone to collaborate and be a part of the openstreetmap Africa community. We will also lay the foundation that will provide us with a solid base for the open, collaborative, and participatory community that we want to build and is needed for our movement to diversify and thrive. You must join us.
